Task 1:

1.	float *pointer_to_float;
2.	long* func1(int a, int b);
3.	char* func2(const char *a, const char *b);
4.	int* array_of_pointers[20];
5.	char* array_strings[4] = {"cyan", "magenta", "yellow", "black"};


Task 2:

1.	The numerical value of &u will be 1100
2.	The numerical value of &v will be 1101
3.	After line 2, pv will be assigned 1101
4.	After line 4, the numerical value of *pv will be 66
5.	After line 5, u will be assigned numerical 67, or as a character it will be 'C'


Task 3:

1.	this code will output: 
	57	80
	80	80  

2.	The first output is the value contained by int1, which is set in the last line of the code to be 57.
	the second output is the value contained by int2, the memory address of int2 is pointed to by both 
	int1Ptr, and int2Ptr because of the line " int1Ptr = int2Ptr;", then the value at that memory address 
	of int2 is set to 80 in the line " *int1Ptr = 80;", therfor the output is 80.
	Finally since both int1Ptr, and int2Ptr point to the memory address of int2, they will both point to 
	the value contained by int2 which is 80.

Task 4:

1.	The numerical value of 'a' will be 1102
2.	The numerical value of 'ppa' will be 1118
3.	The numerical value of '*ppa + 2' will be 1106

Task 5:

1.	
	for (string* i = strPtr; i < strPtr+5; i++) {
    		cout<< *(i)<< " ";
	}
2.	
	delete []strPtr;
