\section*{Part 1: Signal Periodicity}
\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}
The period of a continuous time signal can found using $\frac{1}{f_0}=\frac{1}{4}$.\\
The period of a discrete time signal can be found using $\frac{2\pi}{\omega_0} = \frac{N}{M}$, Where N is the period as a number of samples, and M is the number of samples that fit into one cycle of the discrete signal.\\
The period of one sample is one over the sampling frequency.

Using this we can find that:\\ \\
 $x(t)$ has a period of $\frac{1}{4}$ or $0.25s$\\
$x_1[n]$ has a period of 8 samples\\
$x_2[n]$ has a period of 5 samples\\ \\

Using the sampling frequencies of $x_1$ and $x_2$ respectively, we can calculate the time period in terms of seconds. \\ \\
$x_1[n] : 8 \times \frac{1}{32} = 0.25s $ \\
$x_2[n] : 5 \times \frac{1}{10} = 0.5s$ \\ \\

From this we can see that $x_1$ has the same period as $x(t)$, this can be seen in figure 1 above.\\ 
It can also be seen that $x_2$ has a period twice that of $x(t)$, meaning that it repeats ever 2 periods of $x(t)$

\section*{Part 2: Linearity}
If a system $f(x)$ is linear, The following rule will be true:\\
$$f(x_1+x_2) = f(x_1)+f(x_2)$$\\ \\
When this test was applied to the system $y[n]=2^{x[n]}$ the two different outputs were plotted against each other in figure 2.\\
Since the two discrete time plots do not match all values, it can be concluded that the system $y[n]=2^{x[n]}$ is not linear.\\ \\

\caption{$f(x_1+x_2) = f(x_1)+f(x_2)$}
\end{figure}

When this test was applied to the system $y[n]=nx[n]$ the two different outputs were plotted against each other in figure 3.\\
Since the two discrete time plots match entirely, it can be concluded that the system $y[n]=nx[n]$ is linear.

\section*{Convolution}
The functions $h[n]=0.7^n$ and $x[n]=u[n]-u[n-4]$ were convolved in matlab, and by hand, to produce the function $y[n]$.\\
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=11cm]{x(n).jpg}
\caption{$h[n]=0.7^n$}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=11cm]{h(n).jpg}
\caption{$x[n]=u[n]-u[n-4]$}
\end{figure}
\newpage

The output of this convolution done in matlab can be seen in figure 6.\\
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=11cm]{Convolution.jpg}
\caption{Convolution of $x[n]$ with $h[n]$}
\end{figure}

The output of the convolution done by hand can be seen to be exactly the same in figure 7, with the working below in figure 8.\\
