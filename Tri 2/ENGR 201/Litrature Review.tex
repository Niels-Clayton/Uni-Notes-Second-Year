\section*{Introduction}
\linenumbers
Martian colonisation is often seen to be the next big leap in humanities endeavours to explore and conquer the harsh and hostile environments presented by an alien landscape. To safely and successfully achieve this, all aspects of human survival must be reviewed and catered for within the colony.\\ 
\tab This review will explore and analyse the aspects of human survival that are required for life to be sustained in an extraterritorial environment. By uncovering the aspects of human survival that are most important, research can be conducted on how to overcome these challenges, and provide future Martian endeavours with the equipment required.
